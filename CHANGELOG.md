## v0.10.05

### Fixed
- Hook cache validation: stale `hook_e` cache entries (left over from a previous game patch) are now detected and cleared automatically on attach. Previously, a stale entry could cause the companion to install its hook at the wrong address after a game update, crashing the game when teleporting.

## v0.10.04

### Fixed
- Teleport hotkeys can now be changed from Settings > Teleport, including Go to Marker and Abort.

## v0.10.03

### Added
- German language support, contributed by HaZt-Panda.
- Chinese (Simplified) and Chinese (Traditional) language support, contributed by yv4ev3r.

## v0.10.02

### Fixed
- Configurable keyboard hotkeys now support single keys, one-modifier shortcuts, and multi-modifier shortcuts. F13-F24 and numpad keys can also be assigned.

## v0.10.01

### Added
- Korean language (ko) contributed by Doleun.

## v0.10.00

### Added
- Language support: the overlay UI is now fully translated. Switch between English and Português (Brasil) in Settings > Window > Language.
- Community translations can be added by placing a JSON file in a `locales/` folder next to the exe — no rebuild required. See `overlay/locales/README.md` for the format.

## v0.09.02

### Fixed
- System tray icon not appearing in the compiled exe. The icon file is now correctly bundled and resolved at runtime.

## v0.09.01

### Fixed
- Launching a second instance of CD Companion now shows a warning and exits immediately, instead of opening a duplicate window.

## v0.09.00

### Added
- Show/hide overlay hotkey is now configurable in Settings > Window: choose any keyboard shortcut (default Ctrl+Shift+M) and optionally assign a controller combo (default: none).
- System tray icon: both full and server-only modes now show an icon in the system tray. Right-click to quit; in full mode, left-click or the "Show/Hide Overlay" menu item toggles the overlay window.

## v0.08.00

### Added
- Server-only mode: runs only the WebSocket server, hotkeys, and controller polling without opening the map window — ideal for users who rely on the Chrome extension or Android app as their map display.
- Mode selector dialog on startup to choose between full overlay and server-only mode.
- Focus toggle: configurable keyboard hotkey and controller combo to switch focus between Crimson Desert and the overlay map (disabled by default, set up in Settings > Window).
- Circular window mode now shows a subtle highlight ring around the edge when the cursor hovers over the resize area, making the draggable border easier to find.

### Fixed
- Circular window size is now preserved when toggling between circular and square mode.
- Help button removed from the Settings dialog title bar.
- Application now terminates correctly when the overlay window is closed.

## v0.07.00

### Added
- Waypoints panel: open/close via keyboard hotkey (default Shift+Y) and configurable controller combo (default DPad Down+A).
- Waypoints panel: controller navigation with D-pad Up/Down, A to teleport, Y to delete, B to close.
- Nearby popup: controller combo now configurable in Settings (default LB+Down).
- Nearby popup: "Stay in list" toggle that keeps focus in the current found/unfound list after marking a location, instead of following the item to the other list.
- Settings dialog reorganized into tabbed layout (Map, Window, Teleport, Nearby, Waypoints, Direction, Performance).
- All hotkey and controller combo inputs now have a Clear button to disable the binding.
- Configurable browser zoom level (70–150%) in Settings > Window, applied on page load and on save.

### Fixed
- Closing the waypoints popup with controller B no longer triggers the B action in Crimson Desert (delayed focus return to game window).
- Keyboard navigation improvements in the waypoints popup.

## v0.06.02

### Fixed
- Closing the nearby popup while the overlay is hidden no longer exits the entire application.

## v0.06.01

### Added
- Freedom Flyer compatibility: teleport now works when using both mods together.
- Optional shared entity base: player detection can use Freedom Flyer's shared memory, reducing hook conflicts. Toggle in Settings → Teleport.

## v0.06.00

### Added
- Nearby popup now pans the map to the selected location while navigating, highlights it with a red Mapbox layer, and returns to the player position when the popup closes.
- Nearby popup can now respect the category visibility currently selected on the map, with a Settings toggle to show all categories instead.
- Overlay Settings now includes a map icon size slider for adjusting location marker scale.
- Nearby popup items can be filtered by found/unfound status via gamepad Back button, with found items sorted to the bottom. D-pad left/right navigates pages.
- Title bar now supports double-click to maximize/restore the overlay window and includes a maximize button (square mode only).

### Fixed
- Improved overlay map smoothness when following the player — camera rotation and position updates now match the Chrome extension responsiveness.
- Nearby popup controller navigation now only works while the popup window is the active foreground window, preventing D-pad/A/B from changing the popup while playing with the game focused.
- Nearby scan radius slider now supports a smaller minimum radius.
- Nearby scan radius is displayed as a simple 1-8 value in Settings while still saving the internal 0.001-0.008 map radius.

### Removed
- Calibration UI (button and click-to-add) disabled from the overlay panel.

## v0.05.00

### Added
- Nearby popup: category icon and name shown per location, sourced from MapGenie data.
- Nearby popup: found/unfound badge overlaid on category icon (bottom-right corner).
- Nearby popup: locations sorted by distance, with distance value displayed per item.
- Nearby popup: details panel showing MapGenie image, title, category, description, and found state for the selected location.
- Description links to other MapGenie locations now pan all connected clients to that location instead of opening a browser page.
- Scan radius circle on the MapGenie map showing the nearby scan area (visible when nearby controls are enabled).
- Nearby scan radius configurable in Settings (0.003–0.008, default 0.005).
- Nearby popup hotkey configurable in Settings (saved to cd_hotkeys.json, restart required).

### Fixed
- Nearby popup no longer opens when pressing the assigned hotkey while editing it in Settings.

### Improved
- Nearby popup list no longer resets scroll on each refresh; skips render entirely when nothing changed.
- Nearby popup refresh is lighter while open: location details are cached, the details panel only re-renders when selection/found state changes, and the radius circle skips unchanged updates.
